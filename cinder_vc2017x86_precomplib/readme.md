Going through the very first tutorials on [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/)  
Unfortunately Cinder supports for now only VC++2015.  
And when the dependencies were up-to-date, back then Bresenham was experimenting with a line drawing algorithm.

###  Make sure you have a local copy of [Cinder 0.9.2dev](https://github.com/cinder/Cinder)
```bash 
mkdir C:\[floder of your choice]\CinderDev
cd CinderDev
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cinder/Cinder.git
```  
<br />

### How use the precompiled lib

=> download & unzip  
=> drag and drop to the existing Cinder folder (e.g CinderDev)  
=> in the Windows No file overwrite prompt  
=> Confirm with yes!  
##### It is important that you don't change the path, it shold be: lib > x86 > debug /release folder > v141 > cinder.lib  
  
 Start coding! :art:
